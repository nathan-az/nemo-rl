"""Compatibility shim for CUDA IPC storage handles crossing torch versions.

NeMo-RL hands CUDA tensors from the training venv to the inference venvs
(sglang, TRT-LLM, vLLM) through ``torch.multiprocessing.reductions`` IPC
handles. The storage handle torch produces is a small byte string written by
``c10::cuda::CUDACachingAllocator::shareIpcHandle``::

    [SHAREABLE_HANDLE_VERSION][type byte][payload]

where ``type`` is ``'c'`` (a plain ``cudaMalloc`` block, followed by the
64-byte ``cudaIpcMemHandle_t``) or ``'e'`` (an expandable segment). The
consumer rejects any handle whose version byte is newer than its own with
``received sharable handle from a future version of torch that this version
does not know how to handle``.

torch 2.13 bumped the version byte from 2 to 3 without changing the ``'c'``
payload, so when the training venv runs torch 2.13 and an inference venv runs
torch 2.11 (sglang / TRT-LLM, whose kernels are built against 2.11) every
colocated refit dies at the first handle. Rewriting the version byte of
``'c'`` handles to the legacy value makes them readable by both versions. The
expandable-segment format did change, so ``'e'`` handles -- what the trainer
emits under ``PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True`` -- are left
alone; they still open on a same-torch consumer (vLLM) and trip torch's
version check on a torch 2.11 one (sglang / TRT-LLM).
