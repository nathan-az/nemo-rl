"""Process-global nemo-lens telemetry lifecycle for NeMo-RL.

Two entry points, mirroring Megatron's ``global_vars._set_telemetry`` /
``get_telemetry_handle`` pattern but adapted to NeMo-RL's Ray driver + worker process
model:

* :func:`init_telemetry_driver` — called once on the driver, **before**
  ``init_ray()``. It reads the ``telemetry:`` config block, exports the settings
  as ``NEMO_RL_OTEL_*`` env vars so every Ray worker inherits them, and sets up
  the driver's own telemetry (the training loop and the metrics logger run
  here, so the driver always exports).
* :func:`init_telemetry_worker` — called once inside each Ray actor process,
  from the worker's ``__init__`` (policy, value and vLLM generation workers).
  It reads the propagated env and sets up that worker's telemetry, then
  :func:`shutdown_telemetry` flushes it from the worker's ``shutdown``.
  ``__init__`` rather than ``post_init``, because some ``post_init`` fan-outs
  run on only one rank per parallel group, while OTel providers have to be set
  up in *every* actor process.

nemo-lens is a base dependency, so ``telemetry.enabled`` is the only switch:
when it is false the init functions return ``None`` and every instrumentation
site is a ~0-cost no-op. Lens imports stay function-local to keep the cost off
the import path of modules that never emit anything.

    back to the SDK's own 30s. Four unbounded calls in total. Against an
    unreachable collector each buffered batch is retried with exponential
    backoff, so the cost scales with the queue: 3k spans took 36s under a 5s
    budget when measured.

    That mattered because callers size their own timeouts on this one --
    ``_flush_collector_telemetry`` in async GRPO allows 15s for a 3s quiesce
    plus "its 5s export", then ``ray.kill``s the collector when the budget
    blows, dropping the last rollout spans the flush exists to save.

    So: run the flush on a daemon thread and stop waiting at the deadline. A
    flush that overruns is abandoned rather than joined, which loses the same
    spans an unreachable collector was going to lose anyway, and being a daemon
    it never holds up process exit.
