"""Best-effort mirroring of NeMo-RL's per-step metrics into OTel.

Kept out of ``nemo_rl.utils.logger`` (which pulls in torch/ray/wandb/etc.) so
the mapping stays importable and testable without the heavy training stack.
``nemo_rl.utils.logger.Logger.log_metrics`` calls :func:`tee_rl_metrics_to_otel`
after its normal fan-out to the file/wandb/mlflow backends.

Every series is declared by NeMo-RL rather than by lens, via lens's
consumer-driven metric registry: NeMo-RL owns the ``rl.*`` metric names, so a
new series needs no lens release and no negotiation over field names. Four
families are teed — the async ``efficiency/*`` phase durations, the training
scalars, the ``vllm/*`` engine deltas, and the ``timing/setup`` startup phases.
The first three ride the per-step ``train`` dicts; the last arrives once, at
step 0.

This module names no logger key of its own beyond the ``efficiency/*`` family
it also produces. The scalar rows come from the modules that log them, through
:mod:`nemo_rl.telemetry.vocabulary`, so adding an algorithm does not mean
editing telemetry.

``Logger.log_metrics`` fans a step out as several dicts under different
prefixes, and a key is only reachable from the prefix its own dict carries — so
only the prefixes those dicts actually arrive under are teed.
