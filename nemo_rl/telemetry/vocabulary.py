"""Names shared between the code that produces metrics and the code that exports them.

Every name here has at least two readers on opposite sides of that split, and
the module imports nothing so either side can reach it: an owner is free to be
a torch-heavy training module, and telemetry is free to be importable without
the training stack.

The teed rows in particular live next to the code that produces their keys,
not here and not in :mod:`nemo_rl.telemetry.metrics`: a module that logs
``"reward"`` declares ``rl.reward.mean`` in the same file, so renaming the key
renames the declaration with it and there is no second copy to drift. Owners
call :func:`register_teed_metrics` at import; the rows are collected
process-wide and handed to lens once, on the first tee, so an owner that is
never imported (``ppo.py`` in a GRPO run) simply declares nothing.
