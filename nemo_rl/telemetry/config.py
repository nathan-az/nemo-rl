"""Telemetry configuration schema for NeMo-RL.

The ``telemetry:`` block of a run config. :mod:`nemo_rl.telemetry.setup`
translates it into ``NEMO_RL_OTEL_*`` environment variables on the driver
*before* ``init_ray()``, so every Ray worker inherits the same settings via the
Ray ``runtime_env``. Raw ``NEMO_RL_OTEL_*`` / ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*`` env vars
always win over these YAML values (they are applied with ``setdefault``).

This module imports only ``pydantic`` — it never requires nemo-lens, so it is
safe to import unconditionally from the algorithm ``MasterConfig`` classes.

    later on a GPU node -- or not at all, when ``enabled`` is false and the

    ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`` lens honours. To ride the same
    ``http/protobuf`` endpoint as lens, set the traces-specific var too.

    vLLM traces per **request**, so this emits one span per rollout -- thousands
    per step, against ~20 for the rest of the run -- and vLLM offers no sampling
    knob. Switch it on to debug a few steps, not for a training run. For engine
