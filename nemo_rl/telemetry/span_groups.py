"""NeMo-RL span groups, declared into lens's ``SpanRegistry``.

Lens ships no span-group names of its own: a consuming library registers what
it emits under its own namespace and users select from that with
``telemetry.span_groups``. So the groups that used to arrive from lens's base
class -- ``job``, ``step``, ``checkpoint``, ``evaluate``, ``model_init`` -- are
declared here alongside the RL-specific ones. They keep their original names,
because the names are the user-facing vocabulary and Megatron registers some of
the same ones for the same phases; a group two libraries both register is
shared, which is the intended behaviour for a job that drives both.

Only names NeMo-RL actually emits are registered. Lens's remaining base names
(``load_checkpoint``, ``forward_backward``, ``optimizer``) are absent because no
call site here opens them, and registering a group that emits nothing makes a
preset advertise spans it cannot deliver. They stay selectable in a job that
also drives Megatron: the driver hands workers the raw spec string, so a worker
that imports Megatron resolves the name against Megatron's own registration.

``RLSpanGroup`` is a bag of ``str`` constants rather than an enum or a lens
subclass, because ``managed_span`` and ``trace_fn`` take the group as a plain
string. Call sites keep reading ``RLSpanGroup.GENERATION`` for discoverability
and to keep the spelling in one place.

Registration happens at import, which is what makes these groups selectable:
lens resolves the ``span_groups`` spec against whatever is registered at the
time, so this module must be imported before ``setup_telemetry``.
``nemo_rl.telemetry.setup`` imports it directly for that reason.

    is that their count scales with the prompt count, so a 10k-prompt rollout
    emits ~20k spans where the phase groups emit a fixed handful per step.

    Kept out of the ``per_step`` preset for that reason: ``per_step`` is meant
    to be the detailed-but-usable choice, and its span count should scale with
    steps, not with dataset size. Reach for these with
    ``span_groups: "per_step,per_prompt"`` when debugging an individual
