"""Instrumentation helpers that attach efficiency tags.

Algorithms should import ``managed_span`` / ``trace_fn`` from here (not raw
nemo-lens) so every leaf span gets ``rl.bucket`` when applicable.

Shared bucket tokens are ``productive`` | ``overhead`` | ``idle`` | ``wasted``.
Umbrella groups (``job``, ``step``, ``rollout``, …) are timed but not tagged;
open those through ``umbrella_span`` / ``umbrella_trace_fn`` with the group's
``U_`` alias, so the call site says which of the two it is.

    it is a context manager, so it cannot span iterations at all, and it
    attaches the span to the context, so anything started while it was open
    would nest underneath it. In an asyncio pump that is not hypothetical — a
    task created during the wait copies the context it was created in, so
    unrelated rollout work would reparent under an idle span. This starts the
    span *without* attaching it: it adopts no children, and it does not have to,

    The caller owns the whole lifecycle, which is the cost of the coalescing:

    - end it on the path that ends the wait, or the span runs to whenever the

    - end it on every other way out of the loop that lets the run continue --
      ``break``, or the loop condition going false mid-wait -- since an unended
