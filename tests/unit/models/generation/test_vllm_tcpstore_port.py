"""Regression tests for the RayExecutorV2 TCPStore port patch (RL-1104).

vLLM's ``RayExecutorV2`` allocates the torch.distributed TCPStore port with a
bind-probe that immediately releases the socket, then builds the broadcast
``MessageQueue``, which allocates from the same ``VLLM_PORT`` base and *binds
and holds* what it gets. For an engine that spans nodes the queue needs a real
TCP socket, so it deterministically takes the port the probe just released and
the rank-0 worker dies with ``EADDRINUSE``.

That failure needs a >= 2-node engine to show up at runtime, and no nightly test
has one. These tests pin the port arithmetic instead, which needs no GPU and no
second node, so the whole class of failure is covered by the unit suite.

vLLM 0.29 fixed the race upstream (vllm-project/vllm#53666, #50969): the rank-0
actor binds the TCPStore on a kernel-assigned port and holds it until
``init_process_group`` reuses it, and ``_select_tcpstore_port`` is gone. Against
such a vLLM the port-arithmetic tests have nothing to exercise and are skipped;
``test_patch_recognizes_upstream_fix_and_leaves_source_alone`` covers what the
patch must do there instead.

    * cannot bind < 1024 (the CI cluster) -- all 32 attempts fail and it falls
